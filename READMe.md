# üèóÔ∏è Create a Wireframe Activity 2: Wireframing Solved

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:
* As a developer, I want to be able to see how my elements will be grouped together so that I can better design my website.

## Acceptance Criteria
* It is done when I have created a wireframe using Google Slides that has the correct elements grouped together based on the web app's columns and rows.
* It is done when I have completed the wireframe of the CSS snippet cheat-sheet mini-project.

## Assets
The following image shows a wireframe that depicts the web application's appearance and functionality:

### Instructions
1. Navigate to [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/create?usp=slides_home&ths=true) and create a new presentation using the blank template.
2. Using the tools highlighted in the following image, create a wireframe that includes all the elements that you need for the project:

## üí° Hints
* How do elements interact with each other when using flexbox?

## üèÜ Bonus
If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:
* How might our wireframe look on a mobile device?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

## Explanation and Result
* We started with our header and sub-heading already defined which leaves us with the body and footer to complete.
* We move down our page to create three elements on the same row.
* When we move onto the coding phase of this mini-project you will note that we will be placing these three elements into a container. This container will determine how our elements sit on the row of our web page.
* Inside of our row that is highlighted in red, we see a blue highlighted box which determines how elements sit on the column.
* The container which holds our column acts similar to our row container but on the opposite axis.
* We repeat the steps above to create the next row of our website.
* Finally, we reached the footer of our website which is simply a blocked off area at the bottom of the page.
